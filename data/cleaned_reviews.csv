One pack of the Italian roast can still make a pretty good 16oz cup of coffee. It's better as 8oz - 12oz but you can get away with 16oz. I tried the Taster's Choice and regretted it. The Taster's Choice is half the price but you need at least 3 TC's packs to equal 1 VIA and it's still not that good. Spend the extra couple of dollars on Starbucks. You know it's worth it."

I immediately froze them when I got them, as I wasn't cooking them within the next 24-48 hours.  <p>They dethawed well and I made them as a shrimp cocktail.  They were just as good as any shrimp I've bought in a grocery store, though far from the best I've tasted.  <p>While they were good, I will probably just buy my shrimp from the grocery store as the taste is comparable and then I don't have to pay for shipping.  They were decent shrimp though, so I recommend them to people who live in areas where shrimp is not readily available."

""Gluten-Free Mom""",2,2,5,1310860800,Gluten Free Perfection with Slight Recipe Modification,"My two sons and I are on a strict gluten free diet since being diagnosed with celiac disease a couple of years ago. I have tried many different bread mixes, but this is everybody's favorite after having perfected the recipe a bit.<br />I use the gluten free cycle on my Breadman Pro machine (total time 1 hour 18 minutes). Originally the main problem with the bread was that it would rise to the top of the machine but after removing it from the pan it would partially collapse towards the sides, ending up with an hour glass shape. After trying several remedies, I discovered that the best way to prevent this partial collapse from happening was to wait for the end of the gluten free cycle and then bake the bread on the bake cycle for an additional 20 to 30 minutes. Once you do this, you can remove the bread and it maintains its shape and is fluffy and delicious.<br />A few other suggestions that I would make:<br />* Use coconut milk (SO Delicious Coconut Milk Beverage)  instead of water or milk<br />* Use olive oil instead of regular oil<br />* Use three eggs (instead of one egg and egg whites), then add an extra tablespoon of olive oil for extra fluffiness<br /><br />If you follow these steps, you will have fluffy, moist, delicious bread baked to perfection.

The obvious solution is to take fiber supplements but I HATED those chalky, nasty things.  Then I found these!  Fiber gummies that actually taste good (even the no sugar added ones) and I actually enjoy eating.  When I first got them I actually ate too much fiber unintentionally because I suddenly didn't hate taking the supplements.  Plus, check this out, 2 tablets of the nasty, chalky ones generally have 4 grams of fiber.  But 2 tasty gummies have 5 grams.  These are awesome, if you need more fiber you can't possibly go wrong here.  One thing to note, their shelf life isn't fabulous and they start getting a bit too stiff and chewy if you keep them around 2-3 months or longer.

Labella,2,2,5,1260144000,The real deal,"My husband and I first purchased this exact same vinegar at the factory/shop in Castelvetro di Modena, the tiny town in Italy where the vinegar is made. We were able to taste the various grades (ages) of vinegar right there in the shop, and this ""mid-grade"" version was actually our favorite. Back home, when we were near the end of the bottle, I researched online to see if I could find the same vinegar, as we were spoiled and knew that now no other balsamic would substitute. I was overjoyed to find it was available via Amazon! This vinegar is a perfect balance of sweet and sour. The maker described it as ""everyday"" meaning the one you would use for salads and such. It is not as sweet or thick as the older versions, but sweeter and thicker than standard versions typically available in US supermarkets. I like to give house guests a taste test, starting with a tiny taste of a standard store brand that I previously thought was quite good, and then a taste of the La Vecchia Delspensa 10 yr. We also have a bottle of 20 yr from this maker, so I cap the taste test off with that. The differences between all three are dramatic. The store brand just doesn't compare at all. The 20 yr is syrupy and tastes of currents or raisins. To me, the 10 yr is ""just right""."

For instance: it would be impossible for me to tell if a certain batch of coffee were from Columbia rather than Hawaii without looking at the packaging; however, that level of discrimination is not, in my experience, necessary for me to enjoy either or both varieties. My taste buds know what they like; and they, in concert with my eyes and nose, provide me with all the information I need to make a determination concerning the quality of the coffee being served to me.<br /><br />Melitta has done a great job of packaging their Gourmet Coffee Cafe' Collection, giving it a subdued yet elegant appearance that beckons one to take a closer look. Opening the bag and testing the aroma I was able to tell that this was no off-the-shelf everyday coffee: my impression was of a full-bodied coffee but without the overpowering smell of a dark roast. Time to put my coffee maker into action. Blanc Et Noir is a combination of dark and light roast coffees which should theoretically have the same flavor as a medium roast; however, this is definitely not the case as I was able to detect the dark roast as well as the mellowing influence of the light roast. I drank my first cup black and was pleased at the lack of bitterness. My second cup was with cream and sugar. Both ways produced a wonderfully flavorful cup of coffee that I enjoyed completely.

A fruit snack made with vegetable juice is an amazing invention! Any way to slip veggies in a treat gets 5 stars in my book. I love fruit snacks, but am kind of particular about them. These ones are great! The flavors are really good. I am both partial to the apple shaped one, tastes more like a cherry flavor however. Texture is also really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. You don't have to sit there chewing forever, but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only fruit snacks that I have had that is in my opinion slightly better than these, is Annie's brand and Ocean Spray. However, Annie's is at least double (closer to triple) the price of these, and neither of those brands offer a vegetable medley option. I definitely recommend this product =)"

Costco is my major source for beans and they usually come in three-pound bags. Kirkland Signature is the most common brand, but a few other brands appear from time to time. A problem with Costco is that at any particular time they may have only two or three varieties. But if you come back a month or so later, they still may have only two or three but they will probably be a different two or three. It's something of an adventure and a good way to exp[ore the coffees of the world. Plus, if you find some variety that you really, really like, you may find it available on line, as is this one.<br /><br />Well, here's an excellent coffee. It's a Guatemalan Whole Bean Coffee. Nice aroma, but relatively mild compared to other bagged coffees. Excellent taste, but it's a quite lighter roast than I'm used to. That's OK. I like variety. This one has an excellent coffee taste and is smooth and delicious. It goes down easily, that's for sure. Smooth and mellow. Nice lingering aftertaste. I would think that any coffee lover would find it excellent, but some may expect a deeper, darker roast in a whole bean coffee. For me, this is a really nice coffee.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

At first glance, I would say he hated it but decided to try again when he wasn't distracted by anything. So, after his nap, I presented the treat to him again and this time, he eagerly cleaned it up and wanted more.

By the 3rd or 4th try, my brain had accepted that this tasted different.  I began to appreciate the merits the flavor does have.  The texture is different, too.  Most mayonnaise seems more whipped (with air in it).  This is smoother and creamier.  Actually, more like the food prep mayo I used to use when I worked in a deli.<br /><br />I guess another comparison would be with orange drinks.

Add a few drops of stevia and some malt powder with a heaping scoop of the Special Dark, blend till smooth, and thoroughly enjoy!  It'll look black, but it'll taste delicious!"

I started out putting it on just vegetables as the name suggest, but soon ventured on to seasoning other things.  It goes on just about anything and taste great.  I have actually started using Spike Seasoning as a substitute for salt.  It is low in Sodium and actually better for you than salt.  It is not an overwhelming seasoning; it allows you to enjoy the natural good taste of your food.  So glad I found Spike Vegit Seasoning. They also make other Spike Seasonings that are equally as good.  Thanks Amazon for the Spike Seasoning and until Spike products become available in my hometown, I will keep you on speed dial."

I have a dentally-challenged senior cat who is diabetic (in remission), has a hyperthyroid condition & mega colon. He has lost several teeth so it was important that I find a treat for him that he likes that not only is natural, without additives or sugars but also has a soft, tender consistency that is easy for him to chew. These Real Food Toppers freeze-dried chicken breast pieces were the perfect solution & my cat loved them. They even print ""soft to chew"" right on the packaging. I found this 2-pack listing on Amazon with an outstanding discounted price so I decided my next order would be from Amazon (I also decided to make it an autoship subscription as well so saving even more $). Unfortunately, when the 1st shipment arrived I was quite disappointed to find chicken pieces that were dried up & hard -- maybe 15% of the pieces were soft enough to give my cat. In fact, because when I offer treats to my cat I normally have to break the large chunks into smaller bite-sized pieces, I found the majority of the product in this order to be so hard I could not even break them apart with my hands. If I attempted to cut them up into much smaller pieces with a knife so he could maybe chew those, the product simply disintegrated into crumbs. All 4 pouches in my order were the same unacceptable quality. I also determined that not a single one had a ""best by"" date on the packaging. Since every other package I'd ever purchased regardless of who the supplier was always had dates on them I figured these pouches must have been very, very old. Because I opened all 4 pouches thinking I'd eventually have to find some acceptable pieces I was unable to return the order. When I receive the 2d shipment if there are no dates on any of the pouches then I'll be returning the order (unopened) otherwise I'll open a pouch & if I find the contents unacceptable I'll return the shipment & cancel the remainder of the autoship subscription."

This wasn't dry, but that's OK--it left me lots of sauce to pour over rice.  If I licked the bowl when I was done, I would never admit it here.<br /><br />I didn't follow the instructions.  (I'm terrible at following instructions.)  I started at the supermarket, while choosing the beef.  This calls for thin slices of beef tenderloin, but that's not exactly in my budget.  I went with chunks of a fairly tough cut of beef.  That meant long simmering, which is not what the instructions call for.<br /><br />I lightly browned the beef and set it aside. (The instructions tell you to pan-fry until medium-done.)  I added the paste and coconut and brought it to a boil.  (Hey, I got something right!)  The ""coconut premix"" was a powder that clumped pretty badly.  I think next time I'll add the coconut premix and the water, so I can see the clumps to break them up, then add the paste.<br /><br />I added the beef back to the pan and covered (which you're not supposed to do,) and let it cook for about an hour and a half.  With tenderloin it would be ready in a few minutes, but if you're broke like me, the sauce holds up well to cheap beef and a long slow simmer.<br /><br />The smell in the house was absolutely wonderful.  The flavor was wonderful as well.  It was a good blend of spices, with no one spice stealing the show.  I know that rendang is supposed to have hot peppers, but I don't know exactly how hot it's supposed to be.  This was extremely mild.  Leftovers may meet a little <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LO40AG"">Sriracha</a> to warm things up a bit.

Solid packed, moist, and not a floating mess of tuna bits you find now in those cheap Chicken of the Sea and Starkist products. I immediately bought out the remaining dozen cans, and was sad when I finished the last one.<br /><br />Since then we moved from the downtown, and I was pleasantly surprised to find it still at some of the Milwaukee area Pick N Save stores. It usually retails for about $1.90 and is rarely on sale. I think the last time I bought some, I saved a nickel a can. It doesn't matter, because I always know it'll be good.

It tastes like it came out of a much more expensive machine. We usually use Illy, which we're pleased with; but I'll certainly choose Lavazza in future, especially for the price."

It should also be noted that the contents of the tea bag may only be described as ""dust"", even more so than the average inexpensive, grocery-store teas.  In fact, it tastes almost exactly as Bigelow brand teas do upon their second steeping.  I wouldn't dare attempt to twice steep this Twinings tea.  This latter point and the ""weak"" taste give me the suspicion that this tea contains primarily green elements, rather than black elements -- those new to Oolong with a taste for black teas or whom already enjoy a strong Oolong should avoid this tea."

These food products are also friendly for people with TMJ/jaw problems as well. When I tried Hafi's Cloudberries Preserves from Sweden, I decided to try Felix's Lingonberries Preserves, too. Like the other Amazon reviewer said, if you like the taste of cranberries, then you'll probably like this lingonberries preserve. This lingonberries jam has berries in it and looks beautiful as you spread the preserves on pancakes and soft bread. It's the color red, and kind of reminds me of cranberries, the taste and look of them, especially cranberry dressing and salads during American Thanksgiving meals. Swedish lingonberries are very sweet and tart. My recommendation is to buy both Hafi's Cloudberry Preserves and Felix's Lingonberries Preserves for your household and when you're entertaining guests. Why? - because each person has different tastes, and Swedish cloudberry preserves is more mild with less tartness, and would accomodate the people who wouldn't appreciate the tartness of Swedish lingonberries. If you have both Swedish cloudberry and Swedish lingonberry preserves, then you would cover all your bases in terms of pleasing every family member and guest. When it comes to eating this jam straight from the spoon, personally for me, it is really tart, tangy, and a little strong. While with cloudberry preserves, I could probably eat the whole jar without tasting or sensing a strong tartness. Personally for me, this lingonberries preserves tastes great with vanilla yogurt; it reminds me of Yoplait's fruit in the bottom yogurts. According to Felix, on their jar, they say that these lingonberries ripen during summertime in northern Sweden. The ingredients in these preserves are: wild lingonberries, sugar, and fruit pectin. Felix also suggest putting these preserves on meat. I ordered these jars from the seller on Amazon, and they did a good job wrapping and taping bubble wrap to protect each jar from breaking during transport. Anyways, I highly recommend trying Swedish lingonberries and Swedish cloudberries preserves. Both of these Swedish treats offer different tastes that are yummy and good!"

However, I fell in love with it on first taste, and it has been in my kitchens ever since.  The unique ingredient that Frank's has is its infusion of garlic.  Not strong, but there.  The motto that this sauce adds flavor and not just heat is quite accurate.  I like spice in and on foods, but my measure for hot sauces is whether I can put some in a spoon and taste it without having to rush for a glass of cold milk.  Frank's passes this test; in fact, I've been known to take a nip when I'm just wanting a taste in my mouth!  It seems to be much better distributed in this part of the world than when it was done by Durkee's.  Hard to say whether it's my favorite, as they are all different.

I picked up an 18 count box of Grove Square medium roast at my local Wal-Mart for around $7.98.  I should have paid more attention to the instant coffee notes on the box and taken that as a warning.

I like instant coffee, in fact, I am one of the few people who has actually written a review for Nescaf&eacute; Cl&aacute;sico, an instant coffee of which I have been a fan for many years but this...coffee, I guess you can call it, is awful.  I try to approach each different k-cup with an open mind and open palate but maybe I was just spoiled from all of the french, espresso roast and Nantucket blend that I have been consuming over the last few months but seriously, this coffee would scare a new Keurig customer away from our machines (no, I don't work for Keurig, but our brewer is loved in our home more than our cat at times).  The coffee has a flat, watery taste to it with almost no roast taste to it, even though it is supposedly ""medium roast"", but instead leaves a lingering bitter taste on the back end, kinda like that last swallow of cold coffee that has been sitting around for an hour or so.  I would compare the flavor of this instant k-cup to that of Caf&eacute; Oro brand instant coffee.  I might drink this if I have no other k-cups around the house but I may even, God forgive me for saying this, add a flavored creamer to it just to get my money's worth out of it.  That or I may just return it.  This is a sad day for coffee lovers and k-cup fans everywhere."
